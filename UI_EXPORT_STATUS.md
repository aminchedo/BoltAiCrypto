## Output Files Generated
- `static_preview/index.html` (261 KB, 741 lines)
- `static_preview/styles.css` (59 KB)
- `static_preview/app.js` (276 bytes)
- `static_preview/assets/` (copied from dist/assets)
- `static_preview/export-status.json` (metadata)

## Bug Fixed During Export
Fixed incorrect export in `src/components/PnLDashboard.tsx`:
- Component name: `PnLDashboard`
- Was exporting: `BacktestPanel` (incorrect)
- Now exports: `PnLDashboard` (correct)

This fix allowed the React app to render properly without JavaScript errors.

## Loading States Captured
The export captured the UI in its current state with the following expected behaviors:
- WebSocket connections fail (no backend running)
- Binance API calls fail due to CORS (expected in browser without proxy)
- Loading and error states are displayed as they would appear to users
- Empty data states are shown where backend is unavailable

These states represent exactly how the UI looks when the backend is not running, which is the intended behavior for this static preview.

## Asset Handling
- All assets from `dist/assets/` were copied to `static_preview/assets/`
- CSS URLs were rewritten to use relative paths
- HTML asset references were updated to use relative paths

## Hash Router Implementation
A minimal JavaScript router was implemented in `app.js` that:
- Shows/hides sections based on URL hash
- Defaults to `#/dashboard` when no hash is present
- Listens for hash changes and updates view accordingly

## How to View
Open `static_preview/index.html` in any browser and navigate using the hash in the URL:
- `static_preview/index.html#/dashboard`
- `static_preview/index.html#/scanner`
- `static_preview/index.html#/portfolio`
- `static_preview/index.html#/training`
- `static_preview/index.html#/backtest`
- `static_preview/index.html#/watchlist`
- `static_preview/index.html#/settings`
- `static_preview/index.html#/ai`

## Styling Notes
No styling changes were made during the export process. The preview displays:
- Original RTL (right-to-left) layout preserved
- Persian language UI intact
- All TailwindCSS classes and custom styles as built
- Framer Motion animations preserved in captured state
- Chart.js and Recharts visualizations in their rendered state

## Export Script Location
The export script is located at `tools/export-ui.js` and can be run anytime with:
```bash
node tools/export-ui.js
```

Environment variable `EXPORT_BASE_URL` can be set to change the preview server URL (defaults to `http://localhost:5173/`).
